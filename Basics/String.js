let a ="";
let b = "b";
let c = 'A sentence'; // in javaScript starts and ends with same type of quotes, we can use both single and double for the String

console.log(b);
console.log(c);
console.log(c.length);
console.log(b.length); // .length property after the String variable or literal gives the total length of the String
